    %h4 About Android BlueMap
    %p BlueMap is a free and open source application for iOS and Android Platforms, which detects Bluetooth Low Energy and iBeacon devices and lists them on an open street map.
    %p With Bluetooth LE and iBeacon new communication channels are gained in order to reduce the gap between the analogue and the digital world. Digital information can be mapped to physical spots and establish new business opportunities.
    %p With BlueMap, we are examining both technologies – Bluetooth Low Energy and iBeacon – and furthermore, surveying how many people already make use of this technology in their everyday business. We gather information about the distribution of bluetooth tags and you can participate and obtain our results, too! All found tags are freely accessible via BlueMap (available in PlayStore) or on our website.
